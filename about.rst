About this project
==================

Deck of cards is a set of classes for creating  virtual playing cards. It can be used to make card games. It is very simple to use. The Discard_pile class doesn't work currently but I am hoping to amend that in a later version. This module is ideal for card games such as poker.
the inpiration for this website came from `this page <https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/deck-of-cards>`_. The page contains a tutorial if you would like to make your own version.
